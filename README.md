# dash cheatsheets

Here's my collection of cheatsheets for the super useful [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash). The official cheatsheets can be found [here](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset).

Compiled version can be found in the cheatsheet directory. Source can be found in the source directory.

I'll be submitting compiled version to the makers of [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash), so check your cheatsheets in the Download DocSet section.
